P1:
- make a grammar file (and then eventually write precedence unit tests based on it)
- basic unit tests
- refactor 'print' to be a native function, rather than a statement, as mentioned in FN in 10.2
- after UT, do the parser l-assoc refactor. described in comment (might not be worth though)


backlog:
- write more error productions (makes the language more user-friendly)
