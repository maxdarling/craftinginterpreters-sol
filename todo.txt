P1:
- read and understand all UT, since they're LLM generated (kindof a chore...)
- after UT, do the parser l-assoc refactor (described in todo comment. might not be worth though)

backlog:
- refactor 'print' to be a native function, rather than a statement, as mentioned in FN in 10.2
- write more error productions (makes the language more user-friendly)
- static analysis: add warnings, e.g. unreachable code after return, unused variable (end of ch 11)
