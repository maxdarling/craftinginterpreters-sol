If they enter a statement, execute it. If they enter an expression, evaluate it and display the result value.
I ended up looking at the solution and copying that. I thought of basically the same thing, but not as clean.

I was going to pull all the functionality into the environment, which felt like "pulling complexity downwards", but it's not its responsibility. I was essentially going to have a defineUninit() alongside define() and store uninit-ed vars in a separate container until they were eventually assigned to or accessed erroneously. The book solution is nicer. I thought about the sentinel thing, but I couldn't come up with a good unique value not accessible in lox. I was thinking "hmm, perhaps any value is creatable in Lox" but the java equality operator on a static object is foolproof because it's checking program memory location.

It prints 3. When the assignment expression is parsed in the block, the rvalue is evaluated, and `a` is looked up and found in the enclosing context. It's then assigned to a new shadowed var `a` in the current environment and printed on the next line.

I'm biased because I'm working with Lox, but I think these semantics make sense. Should the rvalue or lvalue get evaluated first, that's the debate I supppose. Or, whether to allow shadowing at all. Or you could just call this kind of double reference erroneous, which I tihnk is fair. This is bad code because it's ambiguous and slightly tricky.
